# luck vs hard work

This project aims to simulate the influence of luck in life by modeling a specific goal: being selected as an astronaut. This is a highly competitive process where many candidates apply, but only a very small number are selected. The project explores whether this selection can be explained only by hard work and merit, or whether luck also plays an important role.

This project is inspired by the Veritasium video **“Is Success Luck or Hard Work?”**

In the video (minute 3:40), success is modeled as being influenced mostly by attributes such as skill, experience, and hard work (95%), with a small contribution from luck (5%). Even with such a small percentage, luck can significantly affect final outcomes.

To explore this idea, this project simulates astronaut candidates, evaluates them both with and without luck, and compares the results to analyze the impact that luck has on selection outcomes.

## How it works

Each astronaut candidate is randomly assigned scores out of one hundred for skill, experience, hard work, and luck. These attributes are combined using a weighted evaluation. The simulation runs multiple times to compare selection results when luck is included versus when it is ignored.
